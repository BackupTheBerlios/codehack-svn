Introduction
------------
    Codehack is a programming contest control system.  It started in the hope
of writing a free software alternative to PC2 (http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/ ).

Features
--------
    Codehack is still-in-development.  Features planned for final release
are,
    1. Basic programming contest control functionality
    2. Chat support
    3. Contest Profiles for extending codehack for miscellaneous contests
and many more which has not yet come to mind ...

Development
-----------
    Codehack is written in Python, hence making the software more secure.  
Asynchronous networking framework (Twisted) is used, which means no overhead
of threads.  See HACKING for further information.
