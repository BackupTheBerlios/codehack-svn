Critical BUGS
=============
    * MindProxy bug: before set_target on proxy, server may call mind method!

ISSUES to be solved
===================
    * Solution file naming conventions will conflict with Java programs
      If we save as 'p%d.java' % pr_no, but the public class name must
      have been something else defined in client side.
      Temporary solution is contest admin must ask teams to use p0, p1 as
      java class names.
    * timestamp when sent from server, particularly in dialup connection
      will have significant delay in client side.  Possible solutions are
      adaptive average response time, ntp, ...
    * Use of 'submission' id as mode of pointing out particular submission
    * Quitting and starting the server for same contest - should it resume 
      last contest or restart it from beginning?
    * Should pc2 style of manual execution of runs be supported?

Definite enhancements
=====================
    * Errback for client login, displays all kind of errors,
      instead of just saying 'Login Failed'

Minor low-priority enhancements
===============================

1. User Interface:
    (.) SubmitConfirmation: Don't ask user for confirmation,
        instead show stats in FileChooser dialog area itself
        and update the stats whenever a new file is 'selected'
        On clicking 'Ok' in the FileChooser dialog, send to server
        without confirmation.
	(.) DBEdit: dbl-clicking should 'edit' that row
	(.) pygtk-2.4: then, set buttons to be default (conflicts with twisted-1.3)
	(.) buttons: set stock icons for custom-labelled buttons
	(.) window: better resizing, constant size (even after
		showing/hiding certain widgets as in DBEdit)
