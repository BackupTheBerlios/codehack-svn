Release (0.10) TODO
===================
    * Refactor Profile (*major* work, need UI in client?, ..??)
    * Ensure generic protocol (requires brainstorming)

Bugs
====
    * TeamClient - Labels inside ProblemPanel doesn't change on .set_text
                   also ScrolledWindow warning is new in pygtk-2.4 
                   side-effect?

ISSUES to be solved
===================
    * Solution file naming conventions will conflict with Java programs
      If we save as 'p%d.java' % pr_no, but the public class name must
      have been something else defined in client side.
      Temporary solution is contest admin must ask teams to use p0, p1 as
      java class names.
    * timestamp when sent from server, particularly in dialup connection
      will have significant delay in client side.  Possible solutions are
      adaptive average response time, ntp, ...
    * Use of 'submission' id as mode of pointing out particular submission
    * Quitting and starting the server for same contest - should it resume 
      last contest or restart it from beginning?
    * Should pc2 style of manual execution of runs be supported?

Definite enhancements
=====================
    * Errback for client login, displays all kind of errors,
      instead of just saying 'Login Failed'

Minor low-priority enhancements
===============================

1. User Interface:
	(.) DBEdit: dbl-clicking should 'edit' that row
	(.) buttons: set stock icons for custom-labelled buttons
	(.) window: better resizing, constant size (even after
		showing/hiding certain widgets as in DBEdit)
    (.) Confirmation dialog for critical actions
