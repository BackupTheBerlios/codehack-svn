codehack is a Programming contest control software (see README).

Dependencies
-------------
	1.  Python (www.python.org) v2.3.x
	2.  Twisted (www.twistedmatrix.com) v1.3
	3. *SQLite (www.sqlite.org) v2.8.x (not v3.x)
	4. *PySQLite (www.pysqlite.sf.net)
	5.  PyGTK (www.pygtk.org) v2.4.x 

* needed only by server

Brief architecture
------------------

	* a new contest is created
		$ ./codehack.py --newcontest <contest_name>
	* server is started
	    : Set contest parameters in profile.py	(eg., 'contest_name' variable)
        $ twisted -noy startserver.tac
	* different types of users (clients)
		- admin : who configures the contest
		- judge : for now, he takes care of answering queries [1]
		- team  : contest team
	* client logins
		$ ./codehack.py -c

Currently there will be an admin account
	# userid: admin
	# passwd: a (asked during contest creation)
And not to say, accounts can only be created by 'admin' 

Other than this just look into the source.  If you care, the prime 
methodology is the OpenSource style (which resembles XP to some extent)

SVN
---
Online: http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/codehack/trunk
Checking out: svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/codehack

[1] compilation/execution are automated - server will take care of that
